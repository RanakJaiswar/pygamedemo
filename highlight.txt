//drawing the bullets
	def draw(self,win):
			pygame.draw.circle(win,self.color,(self.x,self.y),self.radius)
//appending bullets function
	(So the funtion is written to store bullets is list bullets[] and giving them position according to character position , size, color,and in which direction  it would go (where the character is facing))
	bullets.append(projectile(round(man.x+man.width//2),round(man.y+man.heigth//2),6,(255,0,0),facing))
	we would redraw this in your game window using the redraw function(view the code)

//making the character jump
	it was the toughest part to code but thanks to stackoverflow and youtube here is what i came up with
	if keys[pygame.K_UP]:(key for jump)
			man.isJump=True(whether character is already in air or not so player cannot jump while its in air)
			man.right=False(locking right key)
			man.left=False(locking left key)
	else:
		if man.jumpcount>=-10:()
			neg=1(to move upwards in first half of the jump)
			if man.jumpcount<0:
				neg=-1(to start to move down in second half of jump)
			man.y-=(man.jumpcount**2)*0.5*neg(parabolic equation for jump so the character would follow a parabolic path rather than simple vertical path in air)
			man.jumpcount-=1
		else:(no longer jumping)
			man.isJump=False
			man.jumpcount=10
